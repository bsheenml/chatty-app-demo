### React + Firebase - Real-Time Chat App

This project follows the tutorial at [https://css-tricks.com/building-a-real-time-chat-app-with-react-and-firebase/](https://css-tricks.com/building-a-real-time-chat-app-with-react-and-firebase/) from a blank Create React App.

## Motivation

After cloning, modifying, and deploying multiple React + Firebase apps, I wanted to build one from scratch using Create React App. My goal is to practice my git commit flow while helping to ingrain the process of deploying a secure React + Firebase app to memory.

## Errors

Will build and deploy. Signup/Signin functions work.
App will not load chat page.
I tried adjusting Real-Time database rules with no sccuess.

Next: Bootstrap from source code to debug my codebase.

Forking source code and configuring on my Firebase Services:
